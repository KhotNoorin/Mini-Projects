# Dermatological Disease Detection 🩺🖼️  
A deep learning-based application for detecting dermatological diseases using CNNs and Streamlit.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Skin Lesion Classification**: Predicts the type of skin disease from images.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a CNN trained on the HAM10000 dataset.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances model performance with rotation, zoom, and flip transformations.  
- **Interactive Web App**: Built with Streamlit for easy image upload and instant predictions.  
- **Model Training & Retraining**: Train a new model or use a pre-trained one.  
- **Visual Training History**: Displays accuracy and loss curves after training.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python, TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning  
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing  
- **scikit-learn** for data handling  
- **Streamlit** for web UI  

## 📂 Dataset  
Uses the **HAM10000** dataset, a collection of labeled dermatoscopic images.  

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- Improve model accuracy with transfer learning.  
- Add explainability (Grad-CAM) to visualize predictions.
